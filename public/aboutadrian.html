  name is Alfa Grace A. Valentino, she's in the Philippines together with my two children, Jose Sebastian 5, and 
  Juan alfonzo 1y/o. I really missed a lot.</p>

<p>In my three months here in my work is like hell. I thought that working is not so stressing, and i'm wrong, I regret
  regret my decision to work here, I wish I coud turn back the time and work in my old employer living together with my family
  although its not high paying job however, I can still sustain my family's needs. I have a lot of time with my family. I want
  to see my two boys growing and don't want them to feel the absence of a father.</p>
